# Webscraping the travel website(particularly hotels)

This mini project is about webscraping a travel website(eg: makemytrip.com)

Focus on the project:
- Collect all the required details from the page like hotel name, link, price, etc.
- navigating to different page

Notable things:
1. It has javascript in front end
2. Made up of multiple pages(not infinite scroll)
3. [Chromedriver executable file](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) has to be changed based on the version to keep it updated


Note:
- Selenium is a actually meant to be used as web automation tool but it can be used as scraper along with other actual webscraping tools like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, etc.
